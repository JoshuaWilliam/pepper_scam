#Pepper Scams
I like how pepper.com informs you on some scoops. Yet the way they display 
the information as ads is despicable to me. Lucky for us this data can still be scraped.
Enter this script which scrapes all the current active deals to enable you to 
view this in whatever you prefer instead of their shitty UI. 


##Why
As I am looking for ways to learn how to work with Data Engineer tools such as 
Airflow, AWS, etc., I thought a little project that could actually provide 
some useful data for me and my friends might be a fun endeavor. 
Please refrain from making fun of my code as I'm still a pleb.
